# Complex Numbers:
A complex number is written as:

z = a + bi

when multiplying complex numbers i.e. a * bi it becomes `abi`

# Binomial:
A binomial is a math expression with 2 terms connected by a + or -:
literally just like 2 + 3 apparently


# Mandelbrot

z*z = (a + bi)*(a + bi)

z(n + 1) = z(2/n) + c

where c is the starting point (0):

znew = (0)sqr + c

something something

1 + 2 = 3
